>>> Non-Linear data Structures:

Non-linear data structures are essential components in computer science, allowing for the organization of data in a hierarchical-based manner and not the sequential arrangement in linear data structures.

Characteristics of Non-Linear Data Structures:
Hierarchical Arrangement: Data elements are not stored sequentially instead, they are organized in a multi-level hierarchy.
Multiple Connections: Each element can connect to multiple other elements. 

Trees:

A tree consists of nodes connected by edges, where each node has a parent-child relationship. The top node is called the root, and nodes without children are called leaf nodes.

Implementations of trees:


>>>Linear Data Structure:

Linear data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science where data elements are organized in a sequential manner. Each element in a linear data structure is connected to its previous and next elements.

Characteristics of Linear Data Structures
Sequential Organization: Data elements are arranged one after another, allowing for a clear predecessor and successor for each element, except for the first and last elements.
Order Preservation: The sequence in which elements are added is preserved, meaning the first element added is the first to be accessed or removed (FIFO for queues, LIFO for stacks).
Efficient Access: Accessing elements is generally efficient. For instance, arrays provide constant-time access (O(1)) to elements via their indices.



>>Stacks

Stacks are a fundamental linear data structure that operates on the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. 

Basic Operations Of Stacks:
Stacks support several fundamental operations:
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element of the stack. If the stack is empty, this operation typically returns an error or a special value.
Peek (or Top): Returns the top element without removing it, allowing inspection of the stack's current top.
isEmpty: Checks if the stack contains any elements.
is full: Checks if the stack has reached its maximum capacity (relevant for fixed-size stacks).


Applications of Stacks:
Stacks are utilized in numerous applications, including:
Function Call Management: enabling recursion and backtracking.
Undo Mechanisms: Many applications, such as text editors, use stacks to implement undo features. 
Syntax Parsing: Compilers use stacks to parse syntax in programming languages, ensuring that expressions and commands are structured correctly.
